This may be structured as desired with as many confidence threshold limits as you want. It may look smoething liek the following Sample.PNG

Also this folder should be called "Threshold_%" in order for it to run properly, but may be adjusted however you see fit. 

I attached a sample folder with its contents called 10%_Metrics_Detect_txt
